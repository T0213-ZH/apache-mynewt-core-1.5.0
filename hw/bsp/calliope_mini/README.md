It is an mbed-device using an NXP KL26z and like the microbit it has:
* nrf51822 (256 kB flash, 16 kB RAM)
* 5x5 LED grid
* 2 buttons
* accelerometer + compass

These additional features make it even more interesting for makers:
* RGB-LED (WS2812b)
* speaker and microphone
* motor driver (TI DRV8837)
* two grove connectors, one providing I2C and the other with GPIOs
* accelerometer + gyro + compass (BMX055 different from microbit)
